# Unsupervised Learning Course – Labs & Applications

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains my work and applications from the **Unsupervised Learning** course.  
Throughout the course, I studied core unsupervised machine learning algorithms and applied them in practical lab sessions on real datasets.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

## 1️⃣ Anomaly Detection

In this part of the course, I studied anomaly detection techniques and how to identify unusual patterns in datasets.

### Algorithms Learned:
- Isolation Forest
- Local Outlier Factor (LOF)

### 🧪 Lab 1 – Anomaly Detection on Different Datasets

In Lab 1, I applied anomaly detection algorithms to different datasets to:

- Detect outliers
- Compare the behavior of different algorithms
- Analyze performance differences

This lab helped me understand how unsupervised models can detect abnormal data points without labeled data.

## 2️⃣ Clustering Algorithms

After anomaly detection, I learned clustering techniques used to group similar data points together.

### Algorithms Learned:
- K-Means Clustering
- DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)
- Hierarchical Clustering

### 🧪 Lab 2 – Credit Card Customer Segmentation

In the second lab, I applied clustering techniques to segment credit card customers based on their behavioral features.

**Objectives:**
- Identify different customer groups
- Understand spending patterns
- Perform customer profiling using clustering models

Algorithms used:
- K-Means
- DBSCAN
- Hierarchical Clustering

This lab demonstrated how unsupervised learning can be applied to real-world business problems such as customer segmentation.

## 3️⃣ Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

I also studied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.

### 🧪 Face Image Reconstruction Using PCA

In this project, I:

- Applied PCA to face images
- Computed eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- Reconstructed images using different cumulative sums of eigenvalues
- Analyzed how much variance is preserved using different numbers of principal components

This experiment demonstrated:
- Dimensionality reduction
- Variance retention analysis
- Image compression
- Image reconstruction
